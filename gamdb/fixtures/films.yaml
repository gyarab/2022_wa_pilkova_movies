    description: "In 1999, a pregnant woman in a wedding dress, the Bride, lies wounded
      in a chapel in El Paso, Texas. She tells her attacker, Bill, that the baby is
      his just as he shoots her in the head.\r\n\r\nYears later, the Bride, having
      survived the attack, goes to the home of Vernita Green, planning to kill her.
      Both women were members of the Deadly Vipers, a now-disbanded group of assassins
      led by Bill. Vernita now leads a normal suburban family life. The women engage
      in a knife fight, which is interrupted for the benefit of Vernita's young daughter

      at night to settle the matter, but when Vernita tries to shoot the Bride with
      a pistol hidden in a box of cereal, the Bride throws a knife into Vernita's
      chest, killing her. After the Bride pulls the knife out of Vernita's chest,
      Nikki sees her mother's lifeless body. The Bride expresses regret at what Nikki
      has seen but insists that Vernita deserved it. She offers Nikki a chance to
      avenge her mother's death when she grows up, should she choose to do so."

    name: Titanic
    year: 1997
    description: "In 1996, aboard the research vessel Akademik Mstislav Keldysh, Brock
      Lovett and his team search the wreck of RMS Titanic. They recover a safe they
      hope contains a necklace with a large diamond known as the Heart of the Ocean.
      Instead, they only find a drawing of a young nude woman wearing the necklace.
      The sketch is dated April 14, 1912, the same day the Titanic struck the iceberg
      that caused it to sink.[Note 2] Rose Dawson Calvert, the woman in the drawing,
      is brought aboard Keldysh, and recounts her experiences.\r\n\r\nIn 1912 Southampton,
      17-year-old Rose DeWitt Bukater, her wealthy fianc� Caledon \"Cal\" Hockley,
      and Rose's widowed mother Ruth, board the Titanic. Ruth emphasizes that Rose's
      marrying Cal will resolve the family's financial problems and maintain their
      upper-class status. Meanwhile, Jack Dawson, a poor young artist, wins a third-class
      Titanic ticket in a poker game. After setting sail, Rose, distraught over her
      loveless engagement, climbs over the stern railing to jump overboard. Jack appears
      and coaxes her back onto the deck, and they develop a tentative friendship.
      When Cal and Ruth strongly object, Rose discourages Jack's attention, but realizing
      she has fallen in love with him, she returns to him, who reciprocates.\r\n\r\nRose
      brings Jack to her state room and requests he draw her nude, wearing only the
      Heart of the Ocean. They later evade Cal's servant, Lovejoy, and have sex in
      a Renault Towncar inside the cargo hold. On the forward deck, they witness the
      ship's collision with an iceberg, overhearing its officers and builder discussing
      it. Cal discovers Jack's sketch and Rose's insulting note left inside his safe,
      along with the necklace. When Jack and Rose return to warn the others about
      the collision, Cal has Lovejoy slip the necklace into Jack's pocket to frame
      him for theft. Jack is then confined in the master-at-arms' office. Cal then
      puts the necklace into his own overcoat pocket.\r\n\r\nWith the ship sinking,
      Rose flees Cal and Ruth, who has boarded a lifeboat. Rose finds and frees Jack,
      and they barely make it back to the boat deck. Cal and Jack urge Rose to board
      a lifeboat. Intending to save himself, Cal lies that he will get Jack safely
      off the ship. As her lifeboat is lowered, Rose, unable to abandon Jack, jumps
      back to the ship. Cal grabs Lovejoy's pistol and chases Jack and Rose; they
      get away, and Cal realizes that he gave his coat, and consequently the necklace,
      to Rose. He later boards a lifeboat posing as a lost child's father, knowing
      the crew prioritized women and children for evacuation.\r\n\r\nJack and Rose
      return to the boat deck. The lifeboats have departed and the ship's stern is
      rising as the flooded bow sinks; the two desperately cling to the stern rail.
      The upended ship breaks in half and the bow section dives downward. The remaining
      stern slams back onto the ocean, then upends again before it, too, sinks. In
      the freezing water, Jack helps Rose onto a wood transom panel among the debris,
      buoyant enough for only one person, and makes her promise to survive. Jack dies
      of hypothermia, and Rose is saved by a returning lifeboat.\r\n\r\nThe RMS Carpathia
      rescues the survivors; Rose avoids Cal by hiding among the steerage passengers
      and gives her name as Rose Dawson. Still wearing Cal's overcoat, she discovers
      the necklace tucked inside the pocket. In the present, Rose says she later heard
      that Cal committed suicide after losing his fortune in the Wall Street Crash
      of 1929. Lovett abandons his search after hearing Rose's story. Alone on the
      stern of Keldysh, Rose takes the Heart of the Ocean, which has been in her possession
      all along, and drops it into the sea over the wreck site. While she is seemingly
      asleep in her bed,[17] her photos on the dresser depict a life of freedom and
      adventure inspired by her early conversations with Jack. A young Rose reunites
      with Jack at the Titanic's Grand Staircase, applauded by those who died on the
      ship."

    description: "In 2154, the natural resources of the Earth have been depleted.
      The Resources Development Administration (RDA) mines the valuable mineral unobtanium
      on Pandora, a moon in the Alpha Centauri star system. Pandora, whose atmosphere
      is inhospitable to humans, is inhabited by the Na'vi, 10-foot-tall (3.0 m),
      blue-skinned, sapient humanoids that live in harmony with nature. To explore
      Pandora, genetically matched human scientists use Na'vi-human hybrids called
      \"avatars.\" Paraplegic Marine Jake Sully is sent to Pandora to replace his
      deceased identical twin, who had signed up to be an operator. Avatar Program
      head Dr. Grace Augustine considers Sully inadequate but accepts him as a bodyguard.\r\n\r\nWhile
      escorting the avatars of Grace and Dr. Norm Spellman, Jake's avatar is attacked
      by Pandoran wildlife, and he flees into the forest, where he is rescued by female
      Na'vi Neytiri. Suspicious of Jake, she takes him to her clan. Neytiri's mother,
      Mo'at, the clan's spiritual leader, orders her daughter to initiate Jake into
      their society. Colonel Miles Quaritch, head of RDA's security force, promises
      Jake that the company will restore the use of his legs if he provides information
      about the Na'vi and their gathering place, the giant Hometree, under which is
      a rich deposit of unobtanium. Learning of this, Grace transfers herself, Jake,
      and Norm to an outpost. Jake and Neytiri fall in love as Jake is initiated into
      the tribe. He and Neytiri choose each other as mates. When Jake attempts to
      disable a bulldozer threatening a sacred Na'vi site, Administrator Parker Selfridge
      orders Hometree destroyed. Despite Grace's argument that destroying Hometree
      could damage Pandora's biological neural network, Selfridge gives Jake and Grace
      one hour to convince the Na'vi to evacuate.\r\n\r\nJake confesses that he was
      a spy and the Na'vi take him and Grace captive. Quaritch's soldiers destroy
      Hometree, killing many, including Neytiri's father, the clan chief. Mo'at frees
      Jake and Grace, but they are detached from their avatars and imprisoned by Quaritch's
      forces. Pilot Trudy Chac�n, disgusted by Quaritch's brutality, airlifts Jake,
      Grace, and Norm to Grace's outpost. Grace is shot during the escape. Jake regains
      the Na'vi's trust by connecting his mind to that of Toruk, a dragon-like creature
      feared and revered by the Na'vi. At the sacred Tree of Souls, Jake pleads with
      Mo'at to heal Grace. The clan attempts to transfer Grace into her avatar with
      the aid of the Tree of Souls, but she dies. Supported by new chief Tsu'tey,
      Jake unites the clan, telling them to gather all the clans to battle the RDA.
      Quaritch organizes a strike against the Tree of Souls to demoralize the Na'vi.
      Jake prays to the Na'vi deity Eywa via a neural connection with the Tree of
      Souls. Tsu'tey and Trudy are among the battle's heavy casualties.\r\n\r\nThe
      Na'vi are rescued when Pandoran wildlife unexpectedly join the attack and overwhelm
      the humans, which Neytiri interprets as Eywa answering Jake's prayer. Quaritch,
      wearing an AMP suit, escapes his crashed aircraft and breaks open the avatar
      link unit containing Jake's human body, exposing it to Pandora's poisonous atmosphere.
      As Quaritch prepares to slit Jake's avatar's throat, he is killed by Neytiri,
      who saves Jake from suffocation, seeing his human form for the first time. With
      the exceptions of Jake, Norm, and a select few others, all humans are expelled
      from Pandora. Jake is permanently transferred into his avatar with the aid of
      the Tree of Souls."

    description: "Sixteen years after the Na'vi repelled the RDA invasion of Pandora,[a]
      Jake Sully lives as chief of the Omatikaya clan and raises a family with Neytiri,
      which includes sons Neteyam and Lo'ak, daughter Tuk, and adopted children Kiri
      (born from Grace Augustine's inert avatar) and Spider, the Pandora-born human
      son of the late Colonel Miles Quaritch. To the Na'vi's dismay, the RDA, led
      by their new leader, Frances Ardmore, returns to colonize Pandora as Earth is
      dying. Among the new arrivals are Recombinants�Na'vi avatars implanted with
      deceased human soldiers' memories�with Quaritch's recombinant serving as the
      leader.\r\n\r\nA year into the occupation, Jake leads a guerilla campaign against
      the RDA. During a counterinsurgency mission, Quaritch and his subordinates capture
      Jake's children. Jake and Neytiri arrive and free them, killing several of Quaritch's
      soldiers, but Spider remains captured by Quaritch, who recognizes him as his
      son. After the RDA fails to get information from Spider, Quaritch decides to
      spend time with his son to draw him on his side. In turn, Spider teaches Quaritch
      about Na'vi culture and language. Aware of the danger posed by Spider's knowledge
      of his whereabouts, Jake and his family exile themselves from the Omatikaya
      and retreat to Pandora's eastern seaboard, where the Metkayina clan gives them
      refuge. There, the family learns the ways of the reef people, Kiri develops
      a spiritual bond with the sea, and Lo'ak befriends Tsireya, the daughter of
      chief Tonowari and his wife, Ronal.\r\n\r\nAfter defending Kiri against Aonung,
      Tonowari's son, Lo'ak apologizes at Jake's insistence. Aonung and his friends
      then entice Lo'ak to a trip into a sea predator's territory and leave him stranded.
      After being saved from a giant sea beast, Lo'ak is befriended by Payakan, a
      Tulkun�an intelligent and pacifistic whale-like species whom the Metkayina consider
      their spiritual brethren. Upon his return, Lo'ak wins Aonung's friendship by
      taking the blame for the trip but is told that Payakan is an outcast among the
      Tulkun. Later, Kiri links to the Metkayina's underwater Spirit Tree and spiritually
      \"meets\" her biological mother, Grace, whose consciousness lives within Pandora.
      During the link induced trance, Kiri suffers a seizure and falls unconscious,
      nearly drowning.\r\n\r\nJake summons Norm Spellman and Max Patel for help using
      their medical equipment, where they diagnose Kiri with epilepsy and warn that
      she cannot connect to the Spirit Tree again, as doing so may kill her. Although
      Ronal saves Kiri, Quaritch tracks Norm and Max's aircraft to the archipelago
      where the Metkayina live. Bringing Spider with him, Quaritch joins forces with
      the RDA's marine operations, led by Captain Mick Scoresby, and commandeers a
      whaling vessel that hunts Tulkuns to extract an anti-aging serum called amrita.
      Quaritch's squad raids the archipelago, interrogating the tribes about Jake's
      location to no avail. Quaritch then orders the whalers to kill Tulkuns near
      the villages to draw Jake out. Lo'ak mentally links with Payakan and learns
      that he was cast out because he went against the pacifist ways of his species
      and attacked the whalers who killed his mother, causing many deaths.\r\n\r\nWhen
      the Metkayina learns of the Tulkun killings, Lo'ak warns Payakan, followed by
      his siblings and friends. They find Payakan being hunted, and Quaritch captures
      Lo'ak, Tsireya, and Tuk. Jake, Neytiri, and the Metkayina set out to confront
      the humans and rescue the kids. Quaritch forces Jake to surrender, but Payakan
      attacks the whalers, triggering a fight that kills several crew members, cripples
      the vessel, and severs Scoresby's arm. Neteyam rescues Lo'ak, Tsireya, and Spider
      but is fatally shot by Quaritch. Devastated, both parents go back to save their
      remaining children that were recaptured; upon facing Quaritch's team, Neytiri
      flies into a grieving rage and brutally murders many of them, accidentally breaking
      her father's bow in the process. Jake faces Quaritch, who uses Kiri as a hostage,
      and when Neytiri does the same with Spider, Quaritch at first denies their relationship
      but desists once Neytiri attempts to kill Spider.\r\n\r\nJake, Quaritch, Neytiri,
      and Tuk are trapped inside the sinking vessel. After a tense skirmish, Jake
      strangles Quaritch unconscious and is rescued by Lo'ak and Payakan, while Kiri
      rescues Neytiri and Tuk. Spider rescues Quaritch but refuses to go with him
      and rejoins Jake's family, at which point he is welcomed as a true son. After
      Neteyam's funeral, Jake informs Tonowari of his decision to leave the Metkayina.
      Still, the chief respectfully identifies Jake as part of the clan and welcomes
      him and his family to stay. Before vowing to resume their campaign against the
      RDA, Jake and his family accept and live their new life at sea."

      John Slattery), and her younger sister Susie (Mika Boorem) arrive in Cuba during
      the Cuban revolution. A self-described bookworm, Katey is not very happy about
      having to move to a different country during her senior year of high school,
      as she had been planning to attend Radcliffe College, although the rest of her
      family seem extremely pleased to be in Cuba.\r\n\r\nMeeting several other rich
      American teenagers down by the pool - including James Phelps (Jonathan Jackson),
      the son of her father's boss - Katey becomes disgusted when one of the teenagers
      insults a local waiter when he drops their drinks because Katey accidentally
      bumped into him. Katey attempts to talk to the waiter�Javier (Diego Luna), who
      works at the hotel to support his family�because she feels awful about what
      had occurred, but he is not interested.\r\n\r\nKatey watches a film of her mother
      and father dancing and wishes she could dance as well as they did. She and her
      father dance a bit. The next day in class, Katey is asked to read aloud from
      the Odyssey - a passage about love and passion. After class, James invites her
      to a party at the country club the next day and she accepts.\r\n\r\nWhile walking
      home from school, she sees Javier dancing to street music, and he offers to
      walk her home. They stop to listen to a street band and police show up, stopping
      Javier while Katey runs away.\r\n\r\nThe next day, Katey tries some of the dance
      moves she saw. Javier sees her and asks her to come see the real dancers Saturday
      night, but she says she is already going to the country club. Javier gets upset
      and leaves. Katey wears one of her maid's dresses to the country club party
      and impresses James. Katey convinces him to take her to the Cuban nightclub
      La Rosa Negra (The Black Rose) where Javier is dancing with the ladies.\r\n\r\nJavier
      dances with Katey while James sits at the bar. Soon he is accosted by Javier's
      brother, Carlos, who tells him that they will eventually kick the Americans
      out of Cuba. Javier comes over and argues with his brother. James takes Katey
      back to the car and assaults her after she refuses to kiss him. She slaps him
      and runs into the club, and Javier agrees to walk her home.\r\n\r\nThe next
      day, Katey walks by a dance class. The teacher (Patrick Swayze) asks if anyone
      wants to enter the big dance contest and then dances with Katey for a bit. She
      grabs a flyer for the competition.\r\n\r\nWhile walking to the pool, James apologizes
      to Katey and then tells her that Susie saw Javier with her and got him fired.
      Katey argues with Susie and goes to find Javier. He is now working at a chop
      shop with Carlos. She asks him to enter the dance contest with her, but he refuses.
      Meanwhile, it is becoming apparent that Carlos is helping the revolutionaries.\r\n\r\nThe
      next day, Javier shows up at Katey's school and agrees to enter the dance contest
      with her. They start teaching each other dance moves and Javier convinces her
      to \"feel the music.\" They practice all the time, and Katey dances some more
      with the dance teacher, until it is the night of the dance. Katey and Javier
      dance with the other couples on the floor and are chosen to go on to the next
      round.\r\n\r\nKatey's parents disapprove of her relationship with Javier, but
      Katey reconciles with them. On the night of the contest's final round, while
      Katey and Javier are on the dance floor, Javier sees his brother and some revolutionaries
      disguised as waiters, and the police soon try to arrest them. The contest stops
      as everyone flees the club, and Javier has to save Carlos from the police. Javier
      and Carlos talk about how they miss their dad, then they hear that Batista has
      fled the country and join the celebration.\r\n\r\nLater, Javier comes to the
      hotel and finds Katey. He takes her to the beach and they have sex. The next
      day, Katey's parents tell her they are leaving Cuba and she has one last night
      with Javier. They go to the Cuban club where they first danced, and the floor
      is theirs as they are dubbed King and Queen. Katey's family is there to see
      her, and Katey narrates that she doesn't know when she will see Javier again,
      but this will not be their last time to dance together."

      owned by Jake's sarcastic best friend Max. Exploring one night, Baby secretly
      observes Max instructing the waiters, all Ivy League students, to romance the

      class entertainment staff, including Johnny Castle, one of the dance instructors.
      Baby is attracted to Johnny and dances briefly with him after his kindhearted
      cousin, Billy, introduces them at a secret \"dirty dancing\" party for resort
      staff. Max's grandson Neil flirts with Baby in the meantime.\r\n\r\nBaby learns
      Johnny's dance partner Penny is pregnant by Robbie, a waiter and womanizer who
      attends Yale School of Medicine and now has his eye on Lisa. When Robbie refuses
      to help Penny, Baby, without explaining why, borrows money from her father to
      pay for Penny's abortion. At first, Penny declines as it would cause her and
      Johnny to miss a performance at a nearby resort, costing them the season's salary,
      but Baby volunteers to stand in for Penny. During her dance sessions with Johnny,
      they develop a mutual attraction, and despite their failure to execute a climactic
      lift, Johnny and Baby's performance is successful.\r\n\r\nBack at Kellerman's,
      Penny is gravely injured by the botched abortion, and Baby enlists her father's
      help to stabilize Penny. Angered by Baby's deception, and assuming Johnny got
      Penny pregnant, Dr. Houseman orders Baby to stay away from them. Baby sneaks
      off to apologize to Johnny for her dad's treatment, but Johnny feels he deserves
      it due to his lower status; Baby reassures him of his worth, declaring her love.
      They begin secretly seeing each other, and her father refuses to talk to her.\r\n\r\n\r\nScene

      Pressman, an adulterous wife, who instead sleeps with Robbie, inadvertently
      foiling Lisa's plan to lose her virginity to him. When Vivian spots Baby leaving
      Johnny's cabin, she feels spurned and attempts revenge on Johnny by claiming
      he stole her husband's wallet. Max is ready to fire Johnny, but Baby backs up
      his alibi, revealing she was with Johnny the night of the theft. The real thieves,
      Sydney and Sylvia Schumacher, are caught, but Johnny is still fired for mixing
      with Baby. Before leaving, Johnny tries to talk to Dr. Houseman but is accused
      of only trying to get at Baby. Baby later apologizes to her father for lying,
      but not for her romance with Johnny, and then accuses him of classism.\r\n\r\nAt
      the end-of-season talent show, Dr. Houseman gives Robbie a recommendation letter
      for medical school, but when Robbie admits that he got Penny pregnant, and then
      insults her and Baby, Dr. Houseman angrily grabs the letter back. Johnny arrives

      Western series Bounty Law, fears his career is fading, with his recent roles
      being guest appearances as villains. His agent Marvin Schwarz advises him to
      make Spaghetti Westerns in Italy, which Dalton considers beneath him. Dalton's
      best friend and stunt double, Cliff Booth � a war veteran who lives in a trailer
      with his pit bull, Brandy � drives Dalton around due to his DUI arrests and
      driver's license suspension. Booth struggles to find stunt work because of rumors
      he murdered his wife. Actress Sharon Tate and her husband, director Roman Polanski,
      have moved next door to Dalton, and Dalton dreams of befriending them to revive
      his career. That night, Tate and Polanski attend a celebrity-filled party at
      the Playboy Mansion.\r\n\r\nThe next day, Booth recalls a sparring contest he
      had with Bruce Lee on the set of The Green Hornet resulting in Booth's firing.
      Meanwhile, Charles Manson stops by the Polanski residence looking for Terry
      Melcher, who used to live there, but is turned away by Jay Sebring. As Tate
      runs errands, she stops at the Fox Bruin Theater to watch herself in The Wrecking
      Crew.\r\n\r\nDalton is cast as the villain in the pilot for the TV Western Lancer
      and strikes up a conversation with eight-year-old co-star Trudi Frazer. During
      filming, Dalton struggles to remember his lines and suffers a breakdown in his
      trailer. He subsequently delivers a strong performance that impresses Frazer
      and the director, Sam Wanamaker.\r\n\r\nBooth picks up a hitchhiker, \"Pussycat\"
      and takes her to Spahn Ranch, where he once worked on the set of Bounty Law.
      He observes the many \"hippies\" living there. Suspecting they may be taking
      advantage of the ranch's elderly owner, George Spahn, Booth insists on checking
      on him despite \"Squeaky\"'s objections. Booth speaks with the nearly blind
      Spahn, who dismisses his concerns. Upon leaving, Booth discovers that \"Clem\"
      has punctured a tire on Dalton's car. Booth beats \"Clem\" and makes him change
      the tire. \"Tex\" is summoned to deal with the situation, but arrives as Booth
      is driving away.\r\n\r\nAfter watching Dalton's guest performance on an episode
      of The F.B.I., Schwarz books him as the lead in Sergio Corbucci's Spaghetti
      Western Nebraska Jim. Dalton takes Booth with him for a six-month stint in Italy.
      During this period Dalton films three additional movies; marries Italian starlet
      Francesca Capucci; and informs Booth he can no longer afford his services.\r\n\r\nReturning
      to Los Angeles on August 8, 1969, Dalton and Booth go out for drinks to commemorate
      their time together, then go back to Dalton's house. Meanwhile, Tate and Sebring
      go out for dinner with friends, then return to Tate's house. Booth smokes an
      LSD-laced cigarette purchased earlier and takes Brandy for a walk while Dalton
      prepares drinks. \"Tex\", \"Sadie\", \"Katie\", and \"Flowerchild\" arrive outside
      in preparation to murder everyone in Tate's house, but Dalton hears the car's
      muffler and orders them off the street. Recognizing him, the four change their
      plans and decide to kill him instead, after \"Sadie\" reasons that Hollywood
      has \"taught them to murder\". \"Flowerchild\" deserts them, speeding off with
      their car.\r\n\r\nBreaking into Dalton's house, they confront Booth and Capucci.
      \"Tex\" aims his pistol at Booth. Now tripping on the LSD, Booth chats with
      the intruders, remembering them from Spahn Ranch. Booth signals Brandy to attack
      \"Tex\". \"Sadie\" lunges at Booth with a knife. Booth throws a can at her face
      and signals Brandy to attack her. Capucci punches \"Katie\" and runs away. \"Katie\"
      dives at Booth after he fights and kills \"Tex\". Realizing that \"Sadie\"'s
      knife is stuck in his thigh, Booth kills \"Katie\" by smashing her face against
      household decor, then passes out. \"Sadie\" stumbles outside into the pool firing
      \"Tex\"'s pistol. Dalton, floating in the pool, listening to music on headphones,
      oblivious to the chaos inside, is alarmed. He retrieves a flamethrower retained
      from The 14 Fists of McClusky and incinerates \"Sadie\". Booth later regains
      consciousness and is taken away in an ambulance, and Sebring and Tate invite
      Dalton over for a drink, which he accepts."

    name: Flipped
    year: 2010
    description: "In 1957, 7-year-old Bryce Loski moves in across the street from
      Julianna \"Juli\" Baker. Looking into each other's eyes, Juli knows it�s love,
      but Bryce is put off and avoids her.\r\n\r\nFour years later Juli is still completely
      enamored, rarely leaving Bryce alone. He tries everything to get rid of her,
      including dating Sherry Stalls, one of the most popular girls in school, whom
      he knows she dislikes. This does not deter her. Bryce's best friend Garrett,
      who has a crush on Sherry, tells her why Bryce is dating her, so she dumps him.
      Embarrassed, Bryce looks forward to seventh grade as he hopes with more students
      Juli will finally meet someone else.\r\n\r\nThe following year, Chet Duncan,
      Bryce's grandfather, moves in with the family. Juli adores an old sycamore tree
      in their neighborhood, but one day discovers the tree is going to be cut down.
      Juli tries to prevent its removal by climbing it and refusing to come down.
      After much attention from the town, her father Richard convinces her to come
      out of the tree and it is cut down. Juli is almost inconsolable until Richard
      gives her a painting of the tree, which helps her overcome her distress, and
      her exploits are written about in the local paper.\r\n\r\nJuli raises chickens
      in her backyard as part of a school project and soon finds them laying eggs,
      which she sells to their neighbors but gives to Bryce as a gesture. She is hurt
      when she finds out Bryce has been throwing away the eggs she offered, out of
      his father's fear of salmonella due to the state of their yard. Embarrassed,
      Juli decides to fix it up.\r\n\r\nAfter reading about Juli in the paper, Chet
      helps her with her yard work and develops real affection for her, as she reminds
      him of his late wife. When traditional and house proud Steven, Bryce's father,
      criticizes the Bakers' apparent lack of care for their property, Chet confides
      that it's rented, as they devote most of their finances to caring for Juli's
      mentally-disabled uncle David. The property is supposed to be cared for by their
      landlord. As Chet spends more time with Juli and encourages Bryce to be more
      open-minded, Bryce realizes he has feelings for her.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, as Juli
      is encouraged to broaden her mind by Chet, she starts to question if she actually
      likes Bryce. Going with her father to visit Daniel on his birthday, they have
      a difficult but ultimately positive interaction. Afterward, Juli is told by
      a classmate that Bryce has been admiring her, but she overhears Bryce agreeing
      with Garrett as he makes fun of her and Daniel, causing Juli to completely lose
      interest in him. Unbeknownst to her, Bryce is disgusted with Garrett's attitude
      and stops spending time with him, but they remain friendly.\r\n\r\nFeeling bad
      about their indifference towards the Bakers, Bryce's mother Patsy invites them
      over for a family dinner. Bryce is excited, but Juli tells him privately that
      she overheard Bryce making fun of her and her uncle, calling him a coward for
      not defending her. The dinner gets off to an awkward start, but is a success.
      After dinner, Juli apologizes to Bryce for her behavior, and he realizes she
      feels complete indifference to him, leaving him feeling confused and hurt.\r\n\r\nAs
      the basket boy auction, an annual school charity event, approaches, Bryce finds
      out he has been selected as a basket boy and will be auctioned off to the other
      students along with a homemade lunch. Juli finds out Sherry is planning to bid
      on Bryce, but acts uninterested. Bryce hears a rumor that Sherry and another
      girl are going to bid for him and Juli is seen having a lot of cash with her,
      but out of sympathy she bids on a rejected boy named Eddie Trulock instead.
      Sherry bids on Bryce and wins.\r\n\r\nDuring the basket boy lunch, Bryce is
      completely uninterested in Sherry's conversation, and instead watches Juli eat
      with Eddie Trulock. Overwhelmed with jealousy, Bryce gets up and tries to kiss
      Juli in front of all their classmates, but she rejects him and runs off in humiliation.
      Bryce runs after her, and Garrett confronts him for abandoning the prettiest
      girl in school. When he makes fun of Juli, Bryce ends their friendship for good.
      He tries to talk to Juli and explain, but Juli won't see or speak to him.\r\n\r\nTwo
      days later, with Richard's permission, Bryce plants a sapling sycamore tree
      in Juli's front yard to show her how he truly feels. When she sees this, she
      goes out to help him and realizes that after all these years, they have never
      really talked. As they plant the tree, their hands touch, they look into each
      other�s eyes and share a knowing smile."

    name: He is a dragon
    year: 2015
    description: "In the Kievan Rus' of European epics, the people knew no happiness,
      only fear as a dreadful dragon has been terrorizing a local village and its
      people. In order to appease the dragon, the villagers use a ritual that sacrificed
      young maidens and they sing an ancient song to summon the dragon. The dragon
      abducts one of the maidens, but one brave knight traveled to an island where
      the dragon lived to rescue his love, but the time he got there, it was to late.
      The knight and dragon fought a fierce battle, but in the end, the knight emerged
      victorious and the dragon was defeated. The knight freed his people from fear,
      he became known as the dragon slayer for his reputation for killing the dragon
      and the dreaded ritual was transformed into a wedding ceremony.\r\n\r\nMany
      years later, the young Princess Miroslava (Maria Poezzhaeva), Mira for short,
      is betrothed to Igor, who is the dragon slayers grandson. Her father and sister
      Yaroslava think she is immature because she still likes fairy tales and playing
      with toys. Mira is placed on a boat deck in her wedding finery to be sent across
      the water to her future husband, Igor, the same way they used for the ritual
      to appease the dragon years ago. As Igor pulls her boat toward him, his people
      sing the ancient ritual song at their wedding.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the wedding,
      the dragon who was thought to have been dead captures Mira. She is held prisoner
      in a cave where Mira meets a strange creature and a young man who cannot remember
      his name. Mira believes he is another prisoner and calls him Arman (Matvey Lykov).
      Soon, she discovers that Arman is the dragon who abducted her. He lives in human
      form, holding back the inner beast, but sometimes turns into a dragon against
      his will. As a dragon, Arman is unable to control himself.\r\n\r\nArman shows
      Mira the island and a place for her to create a home. He tells her that male
      dragons had long lived on the island. He and his father have been living together
      as long as he remembered, as a dragon boy he had been allowed to choose whether
      to stay human or become a dragon. He chose to remain human until the dragon
      slayer killed his father. In his grief and rage, he became a dragon, gaining
      the knowledge of all dragons who had come before him. Realizing that dragons
      were truly monsters, Arman isolated himself on the island to prevent himself
      from killing humans. Sensing the uncontrollable transition to dragon form, he
      would go into the cave where the dragon could not escape and remain there until
      reverting to human form and almost had his dragon form under control. He abducted
      Mira because of the ritual song sung at her wedding by villagers believing dragons
      to be extinct. The song caught Arman off guard and he did not have time to hide
      in the cave before responding to the song's summons.\r\n\r\nArman wants to live
      as a man and crush his inner dragon because he is afraid of harming Mira. Mira
      talks with Arman and teaches him to live as a human. As they get to know one
      another, Arman and Mira fall in love although Mira is still afraid of the dragon.\r\n\r\nThe
      island is bewitched so that only those who are loved by someone on the island
      can find the way to it. Because Mira's feelings toward Igor change as she fell
      in love with Arman, Igor meanwhile, searches futilely in a fog.\r\n\r\nMira's
      fear of the dragon causes her to secretly prepare a boat in order to escape.
      Learning of her preparations, Arman despairs of ever being able to control the
      dragon and reveals to Mira the real reason why the dragons had brought maidens
      to the island. Dragons bring young girls to the island so they can burn them
      to death and from the ashes of each girl a new dragon was born, that is how
      Arman was born. Arman orders Mira to leave so that she will avoid this fate.
      But without Mira, Arman does not know how to continue living.\r\n\r\nMira returns
      home. While preparing again for her wedding with Igor, Mira realizes that she
      still loves Arman and cannot live without him. While on the boat, Mira sings
      the ritual song to call the dragon. Arman, meanwhile, is ending his life in
      order to make sure that there will be no more dragons and but changes into the
      dragon as he hears the song. He recaptures Mira and brings her to the island,
      intending to burn her. Mira does not show fear to the dragon and confesses her
      love for him. This allows Arman to finally control himself as a dragon.\r\n\r\nYears
      later, Mira and Arman are living together on the island with their daughter.
      Mira flies on her dragon-husband, who is no longer dangerous to her, and they
      live happily ever after.[9]"
