    description: "In 1999, a pregnant woman in a wedding dress, the Bride, lies wounded
      in a chapel in El Paso, Texas. She tells her attacker, Bill, that the baby is
      his just as he shoots her in the head.\r\n\r\nYears later, the Bride, having
      survived the attack, goes to the home of Vernita Green, planning to kill her.
      Both women were members of the Deadly Vipers, a now-disbanded group of assassins
      led by Bill. Vernita now leads a normal suburban family life. The women engage
      in a knife fight, which is interrupted for the benefit of Vernita's young daughter
      Nikki, just before she arrives home from school. The Bride agrees to meet Vernita
      at night to settle the matter, but when Vernita tries to shoot the Bride with
      a pistol hidden in a box of cereal, the Bride throws a knife into Vernita's
      chest, killing her. After the Bride pulls the knife out of Vernita's chest,
      Nikki sees her mother's lifeless body. The Bride expresses regret at what Nikki
      has seen but insists that Vernita deserved it. She offers Nikki a chance to
      avenge her mother's death when she grows up, should she choose to do so."
